Feature: Adding items to the cart
  Rule: Items added from the catalog page should appear in the cart
      Example: Colin adds some items to his cart
        Given Colin has logged on to the application
        And he is browsing the catalog
        When he adds the following items to the cart:
        | Sauce Labs Backpack |
        | Sauce Labs Fleece Jacket |
        Then the shopping cart count should be 2
        And the items should appear in the cart
